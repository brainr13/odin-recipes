    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup flour (for chicken)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 small shallots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup chestnut mushrooms sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour (for sauce)</li>
        <li>½ cup marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>flat leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the chicken breasts with a cling wrap and pound them with a meat mallet until they are no thicker than ½ inch. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides and dredge in flour.</li>
        <li>Fry in olive oil until golden over medium-high heat for approximately 5 minutes. Do not over cook as the chicken breasts will be quite thin and will cook fast. Remove to a separate plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the same pan add chopped shallots and cook over low heat for 2-3 minutes, then add sliced mushrooms, salt and pepper and saute for 5 minutes, then add 1 tbsp of flour, stir and cook for a minute longer, then add marsala wine and turn the heat up to medium, add chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and return the chicken to the pan, let it heat through in the sauce, simmer for a few minutes to allow the sauce to thicken to a desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley and a side dish of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
